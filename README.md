# LLM Fine-Tune
This project aims to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using Mistral 7B and LLaMA2 as base models. Conducted as part of a university course on advanced Advance Artificial Intelligence Research Topics, the project involves training these models on specific datasets (Medical Journals) to enhance their performance for disease diagnosis.
